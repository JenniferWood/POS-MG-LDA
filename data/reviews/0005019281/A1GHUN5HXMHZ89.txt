The	first	time	I	saw	&#34;An	American	Christmas	Carol&#34;	I	immediately	fell	in	love	with	it

I	didn't	grow	up	during	the	Great	Depression	but	my	father	did	and	he	told	stories	that	made	it	real	for	me

This	re-imagination	of	an	Americanized	Scrooge	during	the	Depression	is	wonderful

The	story

acting

directing

camera	work

costumes

sets

locations

music

and	all	production	values	are	great

I	have	always	enjoyed	Henry	Winkler	as	an	actor

but	I	think	this	is	by	far	one	of	his	best	if	not	the	best	performance	of	his	career	to	date

I	highly	recommend	it	for	the	whole	family
