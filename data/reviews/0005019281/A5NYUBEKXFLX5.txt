This	is	the	American	adaptation	of	the	Charles	Dickens'	classic

It	is	interesting	that	in	the	movie	the	main	character	is	seen	ripping	the	pages	out	of	a	collector's	item	book	of	\"A	Christmas	Carol

\"Henry	Winkler	gives	an	outstanding	performance	as	Benedict	Slade

a	loan	officer	who	reclaims	valued	possessions	of	those	unable	to	make	late	payments	on	Christmas	Eve

His	visit	by	the	spirits

the	life	in	the	orphanage	and	how	one	man	helped	him

leads	to	a	very	sentimental	ending

It	would	have	been	good	if	the	images	could	be	enhanced	for	better	viewing

This	originally	was	a	'made-for-TV'	program	and	is	presented	complete	with	the	fade-outs	for	the	commercial	breaks

David	Wayne	gives	a	great	performance	as	the	book	owner	as	well	as	Christmases	past
